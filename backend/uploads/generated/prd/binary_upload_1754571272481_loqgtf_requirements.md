# Product Requirements Document: Request for Change (RFC) Management System

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** ChatGPT


## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for a new Request for Change (RFC) management system.  The system will streamline the process of handling RFCs, improving efficiency, transparency, and communication among stakeholders.  The system will automate several steps in the current manual process, reducing bottlenecks and improving response times.


## 2. Product Overview

The RFC Management System is a web-based application designed to manage the entire lifecycle of a change request, from initial submission to final confirmation.  It will provide a centralized platform for tracking, reviewing, and approving/rejecting RFCs.  The system will improve collaboration between different teams (business, technical, Change Advisory Board) involved in the change management process.


## 3. Objectives and Goals

* **Automate the RFC process:** Reduce manual steps and improve efficiency.
* **Improve transparency:** Provide all stakeholders with real-time visibility into the status of their requests.
* **Enhance communication:** Facilitate communication and collaboration between different teams.
* **Reduce processing time:** Decrease the time it takes to process RFCs.
* **Improve decision-making:** Provide the Change Advisory Board with all necessary information for informed decisions.
* **Minimize errors:** Reduce the likelihood of errors through automation and clear guidelines.
* **Ensure auditable trail:** Maintain a complete history of all RFCs and actions taken.


## 4. User Stories

* **As a requester, I want to submit a request for change with all necessary details, so my request is complete and can be processed efficiently.**
* **As a request handler, I want to review requests for completeness and validity, so I can quickly identify and address any missing information.**
* **As a technical team member, I want to assess the technical impact of a change, so I can provide accurate information to the Change Advisory Board.**
* **As a member of the Change Advisory Board, I want to review the business case, technical assessment, and implementation plan before making a decision, so I can make an informed decision.**
* **As an implementer, I want to implement approved changes and have a rollback plan in place in case of failure, so changes are implemented successfully and problems are addressed swiftly.**
* **As a requester, I want to receive timely feedback on my request, including reasons for rejection (if any), so I can understand the process and address any issues.**


## 5. Functional Requirements

* **Request Submission:**  A form for submitting RFCs with fields for business case, requirements, desired outcomes, etc.
* **Request Review:**  A system for reviewing RFCs for completeness and validity.
* **Technical Impact Assessment:** A section for documenting the technical impact of the change.
* **Implementation/Rollback Plan:**  A section for creating and storing implementation and rollback plans.
* **Change Advisory Board (CAB) Review:**  A module for the CAB to review and approve/reject RFCs.
* **Notification System:** Automated notifications to stakeholders about status changes.
* **Reporting and Analytics:**  Reports on RFC processing times, approval rates, etc.
* **User Management:**  Role-based access control.
* **Document Management:** Storage and retrieval of all RFC-related documents.
* **Audit Trail:**  A complete log of all actions taken on each RFC.


## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:** The system should be responsive and handle a large number of concurrent users.
* **Scalability:** The system should be easily scalable to accommodate future growth.
* **Security:** The system should protect sensitive data.
* **Usability:** The system should be easy to use and intuitive.
* **Reliability:** The system should be highly reliable and available.
* **Maintainability:** The system should be easy to maintain and update.


## 7. Technical Requirements

* **Technology Stack:**  (To be determined based on existing infrastructure and expertise)  Consideration should be given to cloud-based solutions for scalability and maintainability.
* **Database:**  (To be determined)  A relational database is recommended for data integrity.
* **APIs:**  APIs for integration with other systems (e.g., ticketing system).
* **Security:**  Implementation of appropriate security measures (authentication, authorization, encryption).


## 8. UI Requirements

* **Intuitive and user-friendly interface.**
* **Clear and concise information presentation.**
* **Consistent design and branding.**
* **Mobile responsiveness.**
