# Product Requirements Document: E-Commerce Marketplace

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for a new e-commerce marketplace platform designed to serve small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The platform will provide a comprehensive solution for user management, product catalog management, order processing, and payment integration, all while adhering to high standards of security and performance.  The platform will leverage a microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability.

## 2. Product Overview

This e-commerce platform will function as a centralized marketplace connecting SMB vendors with customers.  It will offer a user-friendly interface for both vendors to manage their products and for customers to browse, purchase, and manage their orders.  The platform will focus on providing a secure, reliable, and scalable environment for all users.

## 3. Objectives and Goals

* Provide a robust and scalable e-commerce platform for SMBs.
* Offer a seamless user experience for both vendors and customers.
* Ensure high levels of security and data protection.
* Achieve and maintain 99.9% uptime.
* Support a large number of concurrent users (10,000).
* Achieve fast page load times (under 2 seconds) and API response times (under 200ms for 95% of requests).

## 4. User Stories
